## 01-One-word

**“Yeah”**

Picture this: You're under a curse, and it stops you from saying any word except ONE. What word would you choose?

If I had to choose just one word to use forever, it would definitely be "YEAH". Why? I feel like you can use this word at any time.

Sometimes, it's a cooler way to say "yes." For example, when someone asks you a question, "yeah" is the way to go. And if you need to say "no" or something else, I can’t help you.

(And I also wanna make something clear. THIS ESSAY IS NOT SPONSORED BY THE WORD "YEAH". I simply liked this word and wanted to support it.)

Imagine you're having a chat, and you want the other person to know you're paying attention. "Yeah" does the job perfectly. It’s like a little handshake in conversation. You don’t always need some fancy words or long sentences to get your point across. There are moments when the word "yeah" is all you need.

Let's say someone is talking to you, and your mind wanders for a moment. And you start thinking about something else. Just say “yeah”. They won't notice that you weren't paying attention. Saying "yeah" a few times can give you a bit of time to figure out what they're talking about.

Sometimes you understand what the other person is saying but can't think of a smart response. The word "yeah" is still your best friend. Sometimes I get nervous about speaking up. For example, when I haven't talked for a few hours or when I'm in a new environment. Using "yeah" as a quick reply helps me deal with those situations without showing I'm nervous.

I want to keep this essay short because I probably got my point across. But a brief summary won't hurt.
Basically, I wanted to say that this word is the go-to word for almost anything. Think of it like a basic attack in a video game. It's something you can use anytime without overthinking it. You can use different words, but this is something that requires no effort, no energy, and is still effective.

## **02-First-impression**

# **Hi, I'm David—the go-to guy for all your video editing needs.**

I've always been passionate about creating stuff—it doesn't matter what kind, but I had to create, always. One of my biggest passions was creating YouTube videos. I've created all kinds of videos throughout my life. I also love making silly things, so I created a lot of intentionally bad songs, and many videos that were intentionally dumb, and much more. Currently, I'm learning drums because we created a new band. I'm also the main singer, but I can't sing.

## **Project Examples:**

### **YouTube Videos:**

This was my biggest client. I used to be one of the editors behind the Wojak and Gigachad animations created for the YouTube channel "Hamza." These animations ended up all over the internet and are now used daily in many YouTube videos. (I could say I helped him a little bit to go from 400k to 1.8M subscribers in less than a year.)

### **Music Videos:**

This is my favorite music video. Not the best one, but I had the most fun filming and editing it.

### **3D Stuff:**

My favorite example. This was probably the first time I got paid for something I loved creating. I've sold this model on CGTrader like 30 times since then.
