## **My favorite projects:**

### **YouTube Videos:**

This was my biggest client. I used to be one of the editors behind the Wojak and Gigachad animations created for the YouTube channel "Hamza." These animations ended up all over the internet and are now used daily in many YouTube videos. (I could say I helped him a little bit to go from 400k to 1.8M subscribers in less than a year.)

### **Music Videos:**

This is my favorite music video. Not the best one, but I had the most fun filming and editing it.

### **3D Stuff:**

My favorite example. This was probably the first time I got paid for something I loved creating. I've sold this model on CGTrader like 30 times since then.
