# ***Work:***

But I haven’t been creating content just for myself.

This was my biggest client. I played a part in the Hamza channel's wild ride from 400k to 1.8M subscribers. I used to be one of the editors behind the Wojak and Gigachad animations. These animations ended up all over the internet and are now used daily in many YouTube videos.

And Hamza wasn’t the only big youtuber I worked with.

### **I'm not limited to just YouTube videos. I'm all about anything creative:**

- **For example, there was a time when my heart belonged entirely to music videos.**

(This is my favorite music video. Not the best one, but I had the most fun filming and editing it.)

- **Sometimes I just love to take a project that sounds interesting and challenging.**

- **This was probably the first time I got paid for something I loved creating. I've sold this model on CGTrader like 30 times since then.**

(Yeah, I do 3D as well → so here is probably my favorite 3D model I made)
