# ***About Me:***

I've always been passionate about creating stuff. It didn't matter what kind, but I had to create, always. One of my biggest passions was creating videos.

As a kid, I loved using my imagination. I made whole series of animated characters using just paper. When I was 8, I got a phone that could stop footage, and that's when I started making a bunch of episodes with superheroes like Spiderman and Ironman. I'm not exactly sure, but I think I made around 100 episodes.

But that was just the beginning. I got really into making videos inspired by Criss Angel, a magician. I ended up creating five series of magic videos. Each series had 10-20 episodes lol. 

As I got older, my love for making videos grew too. In my teenage years, I explored the online world, trying out gaming videos, vlogs, and different project ideas. I was so into it that I started around 10-20 YouTube channels. Some of them even had more than 100 videos.

I'm the kind of guy who's practically grown up with YouTube.

But it's not just about the years; it's about the journey.
